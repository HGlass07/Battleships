## Description:

Battleships is a python programme designed to simulate a version of the popular boardgame of the same name. It works by setting out game boards for the player and the computer, with both boards being populated by 4 'ships' each, represented by 'S' symbols on the board. The positions of the ships are randomly generated at the start of each game to ensure variation and replayability. The player is then prompted to choose both a column and row number to produce a coordinate. If the guessed coordinate corresponds with a computer ship, it will be crossed out and it's position displayed to the player. The computer also takes turns selecting points on the player's board at random to try and guess the location of the player's ships. The game ends when either the player or the computer looses all of their ships. An option is given to the player to play again or not.
